         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He laſt Wedneſday being the twentieth of <hi>July</hi> 1653. was the ſaddeſt day that ever I ſaw on Earth, and I thought not that any that cals them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Reformed Chriſtians and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanters, would have Enterprized ſuch an Act. It was the day of the meeting of the Generall Aſſembly of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> at which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>David Dickſon</hi> did Expound in the <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. and taught on 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> ch. 13. verſ. 11. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Robert Doug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las</hi> taught afternoon on 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.25, 26, 27. both of them very holily, prudently and honeſtly, for healing our Rents. After theſe Sermons about four of the Clock, the Generall Aſſembly met in the uſuall place; and immediatly after prayers
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:166649:3"/>conceived by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Dickſon</hi> the laſt Moderator, there came in one Lieutenant Colonell <hi>Cotterel,</hi> and Captain <hi>Cliftown</hi> Captain of the Caſtle of <hi>Edenborough,</hi> and another Captain with them, whoſe name I know not. The Lieutenant Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel ſtanding upon a bench, ſaid with a loud voice, Gentlemen, I am commanded to ask you by what Authority you ſit here: If you have none from the Parliament, Commander in Chief, or Judges, you are to go with me. Now at this time he had ſome Musketteers at the door of the Houſe within the Church, and ſome Horſe and Foot about the Church: M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Dickſon</hi> deſired all that were in the houſe and not Members of the Meeting, to remove, that they might give a diſcreet Anſwer to the Gentleman that ſpoke. After all removed, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Dickſon</hi> ſaid, We ſit here by the Authority of Jeſus Chriſt, and by the Law of this Land, Whereby we are Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed to keep Generall Aſſemblies from year to year, according to the ſeveral Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and every Aſſembly meets by the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of the Former. The Lieutenant Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonell required them to ariſe and go with him preſently, or elſe he would make them riſe on other terms. Mr <hi>Dickſon</hi> deſired time to call the Rols to conſtitute the Aſſembly, and appoint the next Diet. By this time ſome Musketteers with fired matches entered the Houſe; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Dickſon</hi> prayed, and in time of Prayer the Commanders aforeſaid kept on their Hats,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:166649:3"/>and one of them ſpake all the time; the Prayer was ſhort: M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Dickſon</hi> proteſted that this violent raiſing of the Aſſembly ſhould not hinder the next meeting to be at ſuch a time and place as he ſhould think meet to appoint at a fitting oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity; whereupon they were forced to riſe, and as they went out at doors were guarded about with Foot and Horſe, the Officers going before: They went up the Weſt Bow, and down the Bow to the Weſt-Gate, and from thence to <hi>Brunſfield-Linkes,</hi> and there they took up all their Names, and gave Orders to them to go to their own homes at the neareſt; and not return to the Town: But when ſome told him that their way was through the City, and all of them had ſomething to do there: He commanded them that returned to the City, to give up their own names and the names of their Lodgings to the Captain of the Guard that night at ſeven of the Clock, and to depart the City to morrow by eight a Clock in the morning at their perill; and that no three of them ſhould meet together; Whereupon M. <hi>Dickſon</hi> again proteſted to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe aforeſaid: It would have grieved any Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ſoul to ſee the Members of that Grave Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly ſo diſgracefully carried through a great part of the City and Suburbs. Eſpecially Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend M. <hi>Dickſon</hi> late Moderator, and to have heard the Groans and Sighs that were among the People for the violence done to the Higheſt Court of Chriſt in <hi>Scotland;</hi> Yet in this time
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:166649:4"/>and all the next day the Remonſtrators or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtors againſt the decliners of the Aſſembly ſate in the Weſt-Kirk without any to raiſe them, but on Thurſday at night a Proclamation was made at the Market-Croſſe, that all Lords, Lairds, and Miniſters ſhould depart the City by too mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row at eight a Clock, except ſuch as had to do in the Laws, or before the Judges, or could give other neceſſary cauſe of their ſtay: By whoſe inſtigation this was done God will bring to light in his good time, but the Order is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Colonell <hi>Lilburn's</hi> hand: We expected better things at their hands who ſwore ſincerely, real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and conſtantly through the grace of God in their ſeverall places and callings, the preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Reformed Religion in the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> in Doctrine, Worſhip, Diſcipline, and Government, then to overturn our Diſcipline and Government. As for my ſelf I found the word of 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.6. made very lively and ſenſible to me; and I got great liberty to pray and beleeve accordingly.</p>
            <p>God is Juſt, and will not forget a broken Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, He will be a ſpeedy witneſſe againſt Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant-breakers, but in his own time, which is beſt, and till then here is the Patience and Faith of the Saints.</p>
